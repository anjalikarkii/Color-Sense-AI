# Color-Sense-AI

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview
This is an interactive computer vision project that identifies and analyzes colors in an image. It uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model to predict color names and provides detailed information, including RGB, Hex, and a visual display of the analysis.

This project demonstrates skills in:
- **Computer Vision:** Using OpenCV for interactive image processing.
- **Machine Learning:** Training and deploying a KNN model with Scikit-learn.
- **Data Handling:** Using Pandas for dataset management.
